# HACK MIT: Gif the News

In this age, young people are reading the news less and less. In fact, the majority of people only read the first half of a news article, and many visitors don’t even scroll past the opening screen link. For our project, we wanted to reinvent the way modern humans get their news, encouraging them to read more. By combining traditional news sources and modern forms of communication, we created ‘Gif the News,’ a site with news articles summarized into GIFs. By analyzing the content and sentiment of real news articles, we break them down into discrete snippets of information that can be translated into individual GIFs. With this website, readers can now engage with more news, sparking their curiosity and inspiring them to read the article in full.
